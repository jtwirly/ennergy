### Comparative Study of XGBoost and Deep Learning for Renewable Energy Forecasting

#### **Objective:**
This study compares the performance of traditional machine learning models, specifically XGBoost, against advanced deep learning architectures for renewable energy forecasting. By analyzing historical weather, energy generation, and temporal data, the research evaluates prediction accuracy for solar, wind, and electricity demand over consistent time periods.

#### **Problem Statement:**
Accurate forecasting of renewable energy generation is essential for grid integration, stability, and resource optimization. While XGBoost demonstrates strong predictive power in tabular datasets, deep learning excels in modeling complex temporal dependencies. This study seeks to understand their comparative strengths for short- and medium-term renewable energy predictions.

#### **Proposed Solution:**
Two models were tested using the same time frames and datasets:

**1. XGBoost:**
   - Gradient boosting framework optimized for structured tabular data.
   - Trained with weather, energy, and temporal features.
   - Achieved high accuracy:
      - **Solar energy predictions:** R² = 0.97
      - **Wind energy predictions:** R² = 0.82
      - **Electricity demand predictions:** R² = 0.94
   - Fast training and low computational requirements.
   - Repository: [GitHub Link](https://github.com/jtwirly/energyforecasting/)

**2. Deep Learning (LSTM-based model):**
   - A custom hierarchical LSTM network for forecasts.
   - Optimized for capturing temporal patterns in energy generation.
   - Results:
      - **Solar energy predictions:** R² = 0.89
      - **Wind energy predictions:** R² = 0.70
      - **Electricity demand predictions:** R² = 0.91

#### **Data Sources:**
- **Weather Data:** Temperature, humidity, windspeed, cloud cover, and more.
- **Energy Data:** Records of solar, wind, and electricity demand.
- **Temporal Features:** Hour of the day, seasonal indicators, and more.

#### **Key Insights:**

**XGBoost:**
   - High accuracy for all datasets, with low MAE and RMSE.
   - Performed exceptionally well on short-term predictions.
   - Robust and computationally efficient.

**Deep Learning (LSTM):**
   - Modeled temporal dependencies effectively.
   - Exhibited higher prediction variance, particularly for wind energy.
   - Required more tuning and computation than XGBoost.

#### **Challenges:**
- LSTM required significant resources and tuning to avoid overfitting.
- XGBoost excelled with minimal computation due to its simplicity.
- Deep learning struggled with limited dataset size, affecting long-term forecasts.

#### **Future Directions:**
1. **Hybrid Models:** Combine XGBoost's feature handling with LSTM's temporal modeling.
2. **Larger Datasets:** Incorporate extensive multi-modal data to enhance deep learning performance.
3. **Advanced Architectures:** Experiment with Transformers and other models for long-term predictions.

---

#### **Conclusion:**
XGBoost outperformed LSTM for renewable energy forecasting in accuracy and efficiency. However, LSTM models remain a promising choice for temporal dependency modeling in larger and more complex datasets. Future work should explore hybrid frameworks to harness the strengths of both approaches.
