### Comparative Study of XGBoost and Deep Learning for Renewable Energy Forecasting

#### **Objective:**
This study compares the performance of traditional machine learning models, specifically XGBoost, against advanced deep learning architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), for renewable energy and demand forecasting. By analyzing historical weather, energy generation, and temporal data, the research evaluates prediction accuracy for solar, wind, and electricity demand over consistent time periods.

#### **Problem Statement:**
Accurate forecasting of demand and renewable energy generation is essential for grid integration, stability, and resource optimization. While XGBoost demonstrates strong predictive power in tabular datasets, deep learning excels in modeling complex temporal dependencies. This study seeks to understand their comparative strengths for short- and medium-term renewable energy predictions.

   - Performed exceptionally well on short-term predictions.
   - Robust and computationally efficient.

**Deep Learning (RNN-based LSTM):**
   - Modeled temporal dependencies effectively.
   - Exhibited higher prediction variance, particularly for wind energy.
   - Required more tuning and computation than XGBoost.

**Deep Learning (CNN):**
   - Outperformed XGBoost and LSTM in wind energy predictions with the highest R² score.
   - Demonstrated robust performance in capturing spatial and temporal relationships.
   - Required substantial computational resources and hyperparameter tuning.

#### **Challenges:**
- LSTM and CNN required significant resources and tuning to avoid overfitting.
- XGBoost excelled with minimal computation due to its simplicity.

#### **Future Directions:**
1. **Hybrid Models:** Combine XGBoost's feature handling with CNN/LSTM's temporal modeling.
2. **Larger Datasets:** Incorporate extensive multi-modal data to enhance deep learning performance.
3. **Advanced Architectures:** Experiment with Transformers and other models for long-term predictions.

#### **Conclusion:**
While XGBoost provided the most efficient and accurate predictions overall, the CNN model showed strong potential for renewable energy forecasting, particularly for wind energy predictions. Future work should explore hybrid frameworks to harness the strengths of both approaches and improve grid optimization strategies.
