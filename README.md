**Comparative Study of XGBoost and Deep Learning for Renewable Energy Forecasting**  

**Objective:**  
The project aims to compare the performance of traditional machine learning models like XGBoost with advanced deep learning architectures for renewable energy forecasting. By leveraging historical weather data and energy generation records, the project evaluates prediction accuracy for solar, wind, and electricity demand across different time horizons.

**Problem Statement:**  
Accurate forecasting of renewable energy generation is critical for integrating solar and wind power into the grid and maintaining grid stability. While deep learning models are powerful at capturing temporal dependencies, traditional models like XGBoost may outperform them due to their robustness and efficiency with tabular datasets.

**Proposed Solution:**  
Two models are evaluated:  
1. **XGBoost:**  
   - Gradient boosting algorithm optimized for tabular data.  
   - Forecasts energy generation using historical weather and temporal features.  
   - Achieved **R-squared (R²): 0.97** for solar energy predictions.

2. **Deep Learning:**  
   - A **Hierarchical Energy Forecaster** using LSTM-based encoders for short-term, medium-term, and long-term horizons (24, 168, and 720 hours).  
   - Predicted solar energy with **R-squared (R²): 0.88**.

**Data:**  
The project uses a custom dataset combining:  
- **Weather Data:** Historical temperature, humidity, windspeed, cloud cover, etc.  
- **Energy Data:** Solar, wind, and electricity demand values over time.  
- **Temporal Features:** Time-of-day, season, and other temporal indicators.

**Key Insights:**  
1. **XGBoost:**  
   - High accuracy with **R² = 0.97**, low MAE, and RMSE.  
   - Faster training and easier hyperparameter tuning.  
   - Outperformed deep learning on this specific dataset.  

2. **Deep Learning (RNN/LSTM):**  
   - Captured temporal dependencies across short-, medium-, and long-term horizons.  
   - Performance was lower than XGBoost (**R² = 0.88** for solar energy).  
   - Required extensive computation and fine-tuning.  

---

**Visualizations:**  
1. Predicted vs. Actual Plots:
   - XGBoost results align closely with actual values, showing superior accuracy.
   - Deep learning predictions follow trends but exhibit higher variance.  
2. Scatter Plots:  
   - Highlighted the tight correlation for XGBoost, with less scatter than RNN.

**Challenges:**  
- Deep learning models required careful tuning to avoid overfitting.  
- XGBoost’s simplicity was advantageous, especially with tabular data.  
- Scaling the RNN to longer horizons (720 hours) introduced noise and instability.  

---

**Impact:**  
This project demonstrates the relative strengths of XGBoost and deep learning for renewable energy forecasting:  
- **XGBoost** is highly effective for structured/tabular datasets, achieving better accuracy with lower computational cost.  
- **Deep Learning** is more flexible for capturing temporal dependencies and scaling to complex, multi-modal datasets.

**Future Directions:**  
- Explore **hybrid models** combining XGBoost’s efficiency with RNN’s temporal modeling.  
- Test on larger, multi-modal datasets to exploit deep learning’s full potential.  
- Expand to edge deployment for real-time energy management.

**Conclusion:**  
XGBoost outperformed deep learning in this study, achieving superior prediction accuracy. However, deep learning remains a promising option for more complex data and longer-term forecasting tasks.
